    <p>I'll be proving my knowledge in this space. Let's see how this goes.</p>
    <p>I'm a huge VW nerd. Dating all the way back to the air-cooled internal combustion engine Beetles through the most modern electric offerings found on dealership lots. It all started when I was very young, and my mother had a 1972 Standard Beetle. It was my first experience with a VW. When I was 15, I learned to drive in a 1978 Super Beetle Convertible she had bought. I thought it was the coolest car. That Christmas my parents bought me my own 1973 Super Beetle for $1000. I went through every part of that car repairing and refurbishing it and making it my own. It was a great first car because it forced me to learn about basic mechanics which is a skill I’ve developed and carried with me through the rest of my life. I’ve only owned VW’s my entire life except for a couple Audis which is owned by VW itself. I currently own a heavily modified 2015 Golf Sportwagen TDI and a 1966 Beetle and find myself in the garage every weekend doing something.</p>
